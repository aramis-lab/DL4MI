# Overview

This practical session will cover two applications of deep learning for medical
imaging: *classification in the context of computer-aided diagnosis* and *image
synthesis*. The first part will guide you through the steps necessary to carry
out an analysis aiming to differentiate patients with dementia from healthy
controls using structural magnetic resonance images (MRI) and convolutional
neural networks. It will particularly highlight traps to avoid when carrying
out this type of analysis. In the second part, you will learn how to translate
a medical image of a particular modality into an image of another modality
using generative adversarial networks.
