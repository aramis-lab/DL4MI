# Intro

This practical session will cover two applications of deep learning for medical
imaging: classification in the context of computer-aided diagnosis and image
synthesis. The first part will guide you through the steps necessary to carry
out an analysis aiming to differentiate patients with dementia from healthy
controls using structural magnetic resonance images and convolutional neural
networks. It will particularly highlight traps to avoid when carrying out this
type of analysis. In the second part, you will learn how to translate a medical
image of a particular modality into an image of another modality using
generative adversarial networks.

Prerequisite: programming knowledge in languages such as Python (preferred),
Matlab or R.
