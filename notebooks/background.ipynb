    "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the main type of dementia, which are diseases\n",
    "characterised by memory troubles, behavioural changes and cognitive issues.\n",
    "Given that the processes causing AD start many years before the symptoms appear,\n",
    "it is of great importance to find a way to identify, as early as possible,\n",
    "if a certain subject will develop AD dementia. This is important to provide\n",
    "adequate care to the patient and information to the family. Moreover, this is\n",
    "vital in order to provide an effective treatment in the future, as therapies\n",
    "are more likely to be effective if administered early. It is thus important to\n",
    "identify which patients should be included in clinical trials and/or could\n",
    "benefit of the treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagnosis of AD mainly relies on clinical evaluation and cognitive assessment\n",
    "using neuropsychological tests. However, diagnosis has evolved thanks to advances\n",
    "in neuroimaging. Neuroimaging provides useful information such as atrophy due to\n",
    "gray matter loss with anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or hypometabolism\n",
    "with <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET).\n",
    "A major interest is then to analyse those markers to identify dementia at an early\n",
    "stage."

    "Indeed, some characteristics are not modified during the training of the networks.\n",
    "These components are fixed prior to training according to **hyperparameters**, such\n",

    "difficulties of deep learning is often not to train the networks, but to find good\n",
